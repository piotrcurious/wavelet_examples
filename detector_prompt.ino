Create Arduino code for esp32 implementing example of wavelet analysis DSP. Assume code would converge the wavelet basing on audio sample sampled by analog pin after reset , assuming sample lenghth of 1 second at sample rate of 10khz and iterative fitting algorithm. Then esp32 should analyze audio input on analog pin and trigger digital pin each time wavelet is found while setting DAC output to value of the wavelet frequency shift.
